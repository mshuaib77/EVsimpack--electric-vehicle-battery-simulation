EVSimPack is a comprehensive framework designed for the simulation and analysis of battery systems in electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs/HEVs). 
It provides a detailed exploration of various battery models, including Thevenin-type models, impedance-based models, empirical models, and simulations in Simscape.
By incorporating electric circuit models and principles of battery management systems (BMS), EVSimPack offers insights into the real-world performance of batteries under different conditions and usages.
The project covers critical aspects such as state-of-charge (SoC) measurement, cell balancing techniques, and the impact of thermal management on battery efficiency and lifespan. 
Furthermore, it delves into battery pack management, emphasizing the importance of balancing and protecting cells to optimize performance and ensure safety.
EVSimPack is not just about modeling. 
It also includes practical simulations demonstrating the behavior of battery systems during charge and discharge cycles, under varying load conditions, and with respect to thermal influences. 
These simulations are designed to predict the range and performance of EVs/HEVs, aiding in the development of more efficient and reliable electric vehicles.
This project serves as an invaluable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of electric vehicle technology, offering a solid foundation for the design 
and optimization of battery systems and the overall enhancement of EV/HEV performance.
